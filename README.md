# Covid19Dashboard
A project based on building a live Covid-19 Dashboard for India, USA and Global data using cloud-based Snowflake db as the backend.
The project involves connection between Snowflake with Apache Superset for data visualization. 
The visualization charts are built representing various metrics of Covid-19 analysis including the daily cases as well as the vaccination progress.
Using apache airflow, and the pipeline technology it offers, the data modeling tool can be automated to process continuous covid-19 related data.
